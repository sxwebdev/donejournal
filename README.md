# Done Journal

## What is this bot for?

Ever showed up to a standup thinking, _"Uh… what did I even do yesterday at work?"_
This bot fixes exactly that problem.

**Done Journal Bot** lets you quickly log what you've actually finished throughout the day, so when tomorrow comes, you're not staring into the void trying to reconstruct your entire career. It keeps your daily accomplishments organized, generates clean summaries, and saves you from the eternal struggle of remembering yesterday.

Because productivity is great — but remembering what you did is even better. 😄
